# MCP Crash Course for Python Developers

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a powerful framework that enables developers to build AI applications with large language models (LLMs) by providing a standardized way to connect models with external data sources and tools. This crash course will guide you through the fundamentals of MCP, from understanding its core concepts to implementing servers and clients that leverage prompts, resources, and tools. You'll learn how to set up your development environment, create simple servers, integrate with OpenAI models, understand the differences between MCP and traditional function calling, and manage the lifecycle of your MCP applications. Whether you're building chatbots, data analysis tools, or complex AI workflows, this course will give you the practical skills needed to start building with MCP today.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Let's start by setting up our environment. The MCP Python SDK provides everything we need to build both servers and clients.

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The MCP CLI tools provide helpful utilities for development and testing:

```bash
# Test a server with the MCP Inspector
mcp dev server.py

# Install a server in Claude Desktop
mcp install server.py

# Run a server directly
mcp run server.py
```
